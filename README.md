Tensorflow API sample projects

First Tensorflow API demo with the [dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/mask-wearing) from Roboflow

The instructions in [this course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104gwwA0odeVpSR3o=/) were followed 

Because of restrictions of the PC, the result is not satisfying

Cloud computing must be used for better result
